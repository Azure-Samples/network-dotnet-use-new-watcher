# Getting started on using network watcher in C# #

          Azure Network sample for managing network watcher -
           - Create Network Watcher
         	- Manage packet capture – track traffic to and from a virtual machine
            	Create a VM
               Start a packet capture
               Stop a packet capture
               Get a packet capture
               Delete a packet capture
           - Verify IP flow – verify if traffic is allowed to or from a virtual machine
               Get the IP address of a NIC on a virtual machine
               Test IP flow on the NIC
           - Analyze next hop – get the next hop type and IP address for a virtual machine
           - Retrieve network topology for a resource group
           - Analyze Virtual Machine Security by examining effective network security rules applied to a VM
               Get security group view for the VM
           - Configure Network Security Group Flow Logs
               Get flow log settings
               Enable NSG flow log
               Disable NSG flow log
           - Delete network watcher
